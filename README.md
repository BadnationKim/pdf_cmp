# pdf_cmp
To create a simple web application that works as a PDF compressor, you can use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and a server-side language like Node.js with a library like PDF-lib for handling PDF files.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved:

Create a simple HTML form to allow users to upload a PDF file.
Use CSS to style the form and make it visually appealing.
Implement JavaScript to handle the file upload and send it to the server.
Use Node.js and PDF-lib to compress the PDF file on the server.
Send the compressed PDF file back to the client.
Display a download link or allow users to download the compressed PDF file.
